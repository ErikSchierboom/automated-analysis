# Automated Mentoring Support on Exercism

The Automated Mentoring Support Project is a long-term endeavour to support our mentors through the use of automated code analysis.

## Background

The project started in February 2019. For more information, we recommend reading [our announcement](https://exercism.io/blog/automated-mentoring-support-project) or this repository's [about document](./docs/about.md).

## Analyzers

If you would like to get involved in [an existing analyzer, please open an issue in its repository](https://github.com/exercism?q=analyzer) asking if there is somewhere you can help.

If you would like to create an analyzer for a different language, please follow the [these instructions](./docs/creating-an-analyzer.md).

## The Interface

Analyzers are responsible for analyzing code. They are managed by an orchestrator and must adhere to an interface, which is [defined here](./docs/interface.md).
